# The Slime King - Product Overview

## Game Concept

The Slime King is a cozy 2D top-down RPG focused on exploration, puzzle-solving, and gradual progression. Players control a slime creature that evolves by absorbing elemental fragments in a relaxed, accessible world with minimal combat.

## Core Mechanics

- **Evolution System**: Progress from Hatchling → Young → Adult → King based on XP from elemental fragments
- **Elemental Fragments**: Six types (Water, Fire, Nature, Earth, Air, Darkness) absorbed automatically on contact
- **Skill Tree**: Purchase abilities using specific elemental fragments
- **Inventory**: 12 slots (3×4 grid), non-stackable items
- **Quick Slots**: 4 slots for instant item/ability access
- **Followers**: Recruit allied NPCs (limit increases with evolution: 0→1→2→4)
- **Lives System**: Start with 3 lives, max 10 (increases with evolution)

## Gameplay Focus

- **Exploration-first**: Low combat frequency, emphasis on discovery
- **Puzzle-solving**: Environmental puzzles, destructible objects, interactive points
- **NPC Relationships**: Dynamic faction system (Ally/Neutral/Enemy) affected by player actions
- **Quest System**: Collection, destruction, escort, and exploration quests
- **Day/Night Cycle**: 1 game hour = 10 real minutes
- **Weather & Seasons**: Randomized daily weather, seasonal changes every 7 real days
